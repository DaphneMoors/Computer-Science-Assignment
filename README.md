This code is a duplicate detection method. The code includes multiple sections: cleaning, creating model words, merging TVs by modelID, creating the binary dictionary, creating the signature matrix, creating candidate pairs through LSH, a clustering part and finally an evaluation part. The results can be plotted afterwards using the codes at the bottom.

The code is supposed to be run in a bootstrap, where for each bootstrap r = 1,2,3,...,18,19,20 is used. For each r, the evaluation metrics should be averaged over all bootstraps.
